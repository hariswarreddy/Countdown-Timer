# Countdown-Timer
This project is a Countdown Timer that dynamically calculates and displays the time remaining to a user-specified target date. It features an intuitive UI built with HTML and styled with CSS. The timer updates every second, displaying days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and delivers a message when the countdown ends.
